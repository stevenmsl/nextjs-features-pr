Client-side Data Fetching
- the page is still pre-rendered #CSDF01
- when data don't need to be pre-rendered #CSDF02
  - data change frequently and don't need
    to be seen by the search engines
  - highly specific data like orders of
    a user 
- make sure you separate the util functions that
  can only be used on the server side from others 
  and put them in their own files. #CSDF03
- you can combine pre-fetching with client-side fetching
  - #CSDF04
